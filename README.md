======================

Quick script made back in early 2014 with Python.

## Dependencies

It's based on *Selenium*, a web browser automation tool. You can find out more <a href="http://www.seleniumhq.org/">here</a>.

You can install the Python selenium package with `pip install selenium`. 

Selenium expects you to have Chrome installed in the default location for your operating system.
You'll also need to make sure that you have the required ChromeDriver executable and
that its path is properly made available to WebDriver. 
See Google's <a href="https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/ChromeDriver">ChromeDriver site</a>
for details.
 
## Usage
 
 Run the script in any shell with `python main.py` on a system with Python installed/configured.
 
 Follow the prompts to input user information, desired messages, message quantity, and time interval data.
 
 Finally, let it run!!!!
